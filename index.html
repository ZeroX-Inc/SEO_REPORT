                        <p><strong>Dear Friends, Partners, and Supporters,</strong></p>
                        <p>Today's technology landscape is evolving at an unprecedented pace. To meet this moment, we must reimagine how we equip the next generation of tech leaders. The SEO Tech Developer program emerged from this imperative: our commitment to not only adapt to the ever-changing world of tech, but also to ensure that talented young people have the tools, confidence, and opportunities to thrive within it.</p>
                        <p>I am proud to share the extraordinary impact the SEO Tech Developer program has made on the lives of each participant who has walked through our doors. This past year alone, we've seen students land internships at top tech companies, navigate new reservoirs of confidence, and take bold steps toward futures they once only dreamed were possible.</p>
                        <p>Yet these stories of transformation are about more than individual achievements — they reflect a movement toward collective change, paving new pathways for generations to follow. Each success becomes a signal of what's possible, fueling the ripple effect that lies at the core of our mission.</p>
                        <p>Through comprehensive technical training and dedicated professional development, the SEO Tech Developer program does more than prepare students for coveted careers in tech. We fundamentally alter the trajectory of their professional lives, transforming potential into performance and aspiration into achievement.</p>
                        <p>None of this progress would be possible without the powerful partnerships that amplify our reach and deepen our impact. Our partners understand that closing opportunity gaps requires collective action and tireless dedication. Together, we show what becomes possible when talent meets opportunity.</p>
                        <p>As you review the stories and statistics that follow, I invite you to see beyond the numbers to the lives they represent. Each data point reflects a student who dared to dream bigger, a family whose trajectory has been altered, and a tech industry that becomes stronger with each graduate we send into the field.</p>

                        The Summer Residency culminates in a final project where students showcase the skills they learn in frontend and backend development. Students are expected to adhere to industry-standard project management frameworks and SWE standards. They work in groups of 3-5, meeting regularly with their EMs to guide their progress. Once students deploy their projects online, external judges review their work and provide tech leadership roles review their work and provide feedback and mentorship. Projects function as a realistic gateway for students from academic backgrounds to apply lessons from the curriculum.
